# JavaCourseProject
Course Project for CIS18A (Online Ordering)

This program is for a small business that sells burgers drinks and shakes. 
The program allows the user to order food from the business and have it deliver it to them.
It starts off by asking the users address and saves it for later.
Then shows the user the menu and asks "What would you like to order?"
The user also has the option to exit the program, check total, and proceed to checkout.
Once the user is ready the user can proceed to checkout and is shown how much their order is and that their order will arrive to the address they put in.
